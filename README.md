# Jasmine's Portfolio

## Description
This is my portfolio showcasing my projects over a week in coding! This portfolio is built using HTML and CSS with a focus on applying various styling methods/ to ensure an an accessible landing page. The HTML follows best practices in using semantic HTML and notes in the styling sheet to demonstrate a clear workflow. Creative functionality was practiced in ensuring links deplyed to appropriate tabs.

## User Story

AS AN employer I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
